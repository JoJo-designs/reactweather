# React Weather

## Goal 
My gaol is to rebuild an weather app that I have built in the past this time using react. When I was working on the app I realized that it was very slow to load and display data. The original app used javascript to rended the page. I am hoping that using a powerful  rendering engine will allow the app to be more efficient and load quicker.
